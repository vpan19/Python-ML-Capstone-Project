# Coursera_Capstone
This repository is for the Capstone project .
My first try with python and machine learning
  
Purpose of this project was to identify areas in Melbourne close to CBD (within 5km) with low to no Vietnamese restaurants to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new Vietnamese restaurant.
 By using our primary data and the Foursquare data we have first identified the restaurants and venues according to their frequency of occurrence in each Suburb. Clustering of those locations was then performed to filter the data according to their frequencies and their distance from the CBD. The filtering of clusters has helped us narrows our search from 88 suburbs down to the 5 suburbs which we believe might be the best location for opening a new Vietnamese restaurant taking all other factors constant and considering the data limitation. However, final decision on optimal restaurant location will be made by stakeholders based on specific characteristics of suburbs and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like attractiveness of each location (proximity to parking and train station), levels of noise / proximity to major roads, real estate availability and prices, social and economic dynamics of every suburb etc
